# Family Tree

[![Shields.io](https://img.shields.io/badge/type-college%20project-orange?style=flat)](http://shields.io/)

This Project is the classic family tree example using Prolog. Prolog is a logical programming based on a variant of 1st order logic. To 'program' in Prolog you create a knowledge base of facts and rules about the problem. Then you may query the knowledge base. Prolog uses a modified backchaining algorithm to search the knowledge base in an attempt to prove the query.

Free versions of Prolog are available. I would recommend the one produced by the GNU Foundation, available at http://www.gprolog.org/.

For this project, I created a knowledge base that defines the rules of Genealogy - i.e. that 'understands' family relationships. Specifically the knowledge base should contain rules that define:

- parent
- child
- sibling
- related
- decendent
- ancestor
- etc.
